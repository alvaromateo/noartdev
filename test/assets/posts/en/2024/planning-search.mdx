            In this post I will go over my thought process in designing and planning the 
            search functionality of the website.

        Before starting to <Link href='/blog/configuring-solr'>configure Solr</Link> 
        I think it's important to do a bit of thinking about what features do you want the 
        search to have and plan the endpoints that will be used, how the documents will be 
        indexed and when/how they will be indexed.

        ## Features

        For my webpage I'm thinking about having the following functionality:
        - When users start typing they should get suggestions based on all the posts titles 
        and subtitles so they can go directly to the page they are most interested in.
        - I want to have <Link href='https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/query-guide/faceting.html'>faceting</Link> 
        (arrange the results in categories) so that the users can see the results of their search by tags and/or date.
        - Finally, if the user types a word or sentence and wants to see relevant results, 
        the search should look over all the text and code in the post.

        For the relevance of the results, I want the priority of the search to be *title > 
        subtitles > summary > text > code*. In addition, in the results page I would like to display 
        the title of the page and the piece of text where the relevant result appears, same 
        as when I search something in Google (this in Solr is called 
        <Link href='https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/query-guide/highlighting.html'>Highlighting</Link>).

        ## Solr document structure

        To index each article, it is needed to send a *document* (JSON) to Solr which will be 
        analyzed and parsed based on the field types defined and configured. This is why it 
        is important to plan how the document will be before configuring Solr - it will give me a 
        list of all the fields I need to set up in the configuration.

        Based on the features that I just mentioned, I will define the post document to be send to Solr 
        like this:

        <CodeBlock language='typescript'>
{`interface PostDocument {
  url: string,
  title: string,
  date: Date,
  tags: string[],
  summary: string,
  sections: string[],
  text: string[],
  code: string[]
}
`}
        </CodeBlock>

        The *url* field is needed because that is the result that the users will want from the search 
        (the page they are looking for). The *title* and *sections* will serve to power the suggestions 
        functionality. The *date* and *tags* will be used for the faceting. Finally, the *summary*, 
        *text* and *code* are to be analyzed to provide results for any kind of text search.

        For now I decided to split every field, as I have no idea yet how to give more importance to 
        some fields and I thought that it might be needed this way, but of course it's subject to change 
        based on what I discover when I move on to the implementation of the feature.

        ## Solr endpoints

        To serve the different functionalities there will be various endpoints:
        - update: it is one of the default handlers and will be used to handle the indexing of documents.
        - suggest: it will be the handler for the requests send along as the user types to get suggestions.
        - query: this handler will take care of a request sent by the user.

        ## Conclusion

        Now that I have an idea of how the search will work and how the documents will be indexed 
        I can move on and start configuring Solr (and later the fun part of programming everything).

        Until next time!
