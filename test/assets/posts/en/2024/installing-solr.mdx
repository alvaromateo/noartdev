            In this post I will show how to install 
            <Link href='https://solr.apache.org/'>Solr</Link> to use it as search engine for a blog
            website.

        <Link href='https://solr.apache.org/'>Solr</Link> has a couple installation possibilities. 
        There's the classic manual installation and also the possibility to run it in a Docker 
        container. I believe going through with the Docker installation is better in the long term, 
        as it leaves more options open to choose a Cloud provider - I could choose a VPS or run it 
        directly in a containerized Cloud environment. In addition, once done the setup if I need 
        to deploy it to different environments I won't need to repeat all the manual installation 
        work.

        ## Docker

        First I focused on setting up the development environment. I do this for fun, so I don't want 
        to have to struggle everytime I try to code something. It has to be smooth and simple to run, 
        still giving me access to all the benefits of Next development process (mainly HMR - Hot Module 
        Replacement).

        To do the set up of the environment (both for development and for production) I decided to go 
        with <Link href='https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/'>Docker Compose</Link> 
        because it's a technology I had already used in the past a bit, and I know that I can get all the 
        environment up and running by just typing:

        <CodeBlock language='bash'>
{`docker compose up`}
        </CodeBlock>

        ### Set up

        The setup is very simple. I just followed the instructions on how to deploy using Docker available 
        in the NextJS 
        <Link href='https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying#docker-image'>docs</Link>. 
        I used the multi environment example provided to set up 2 environments:
        - A development environment to use in my laptop.
        - A production environment that is the one I will use when I want to do the deployment to GCP.

        To be able to use the Dockerfile provided I had to modify my *next.config.js* file to add 
        <CodeBlock language='json' inline>\{ "output": "standalone" \}</CodeBlock> to the 
        *module.exports* of the file.

        In this post I'm focusing only on the development environment. I'll later publish another article for 
        how to deploy the whole application to production. I modified the example provided to add a network 
        separation between the FE and the BE and the container where solar will run. This is the result:

        <CodeBlock language='yaml'>
{`version: '2'

services:
    next:
        build:
            context: ../../
            dockerfile: docker/development/next/Dockerfile
        image: noart/next
        ports:
            - "80:3000"
            - "443:3000"
        networks:
            - frontend
            - backend
    solr:
        build:
            context: ../../
            dockerfile: docker/development/solr/Dockerfile
        image: noart/solr
        ports:
            - "8983:8983"
        volumes:
            - data:/var/solr
        networks:
            - backend

volumes:
    data:

networks:
    frontend: {}
    backend: {}
`}
        </CodeBlock>

        Logically, the context and dockerfile paths are relative to the project root directory and 
        where the *docker-compose.yml* file is located. The structure of the project is available 
        in my <Link href='https://github.com/alvaromateo/noartdev'>GitHub</Link> (notice that if 
        you read this some time after its publication I may have added or changed  some things).

        ## Installation

        After the *docker-compose.yml* file is done, the next step is to build the container image 
        for Solr. To do this, I am going to use the 
        <Link href='https://hub.docker.com/_/solr?tab=tags'>official base image </Link> 
        provided by the Solr project.

        Solr has a feature called *configsets* by which it can load predefined configurations for a 
        given core. These sets go in the Solr home folder by default and can be used to let different 
        cores share configuration. For now, I'll just copy the default files from Solr (so I can later 
        modify them) and put them inside a folder next to the Dockerfile called *config*, following 
        the structure specified in the <Link href='https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/configuration-guide/config-sets.html'>Configsets Documentation</Link>.

        The default configuration files can be found in Solr's GitHub. Just the following two are 
        needed to understand how Solr works:
        - <Link href='https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/main/solr/server/solr/configsets/_default/conf/solrconfig.xml'>solrconfig.xml</Link>
        - <Link href='https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/main/solr/server/solr/configsets/_default/conf/managed-schema.xml'>managed-schema.xml</Link>

        Once this is done, I can write the *Dockerfile* and copy the just added files to the image. 
        I also take the opportunity to specify the necessary command to start solr and create a core.
        The Solr command is defined in the *ENTRYPOINT*, so with the *CMD* instruction I can define the 
        parameters to be passed - <Link href='https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#cmd'>Docker reference</Link>.

        <CodeBlock language='docker'>
{`FROM solr:slim

WORKDIR /var/solr/data
RUN mkdir -p configsets/blog-configset/conf
COPY docker/development/solr/config/ ./configsets/blog-configset/conf

# add as last parameter "configsets/blog-configset" when the custom configuration is ready
CMD ["solr-precreate", "posts"]
`}
        </CodeBlock>

        ## Conclusion

        And like this I have a running NextJS container and another one with Solr. Even with 
        the default configuration, Solr will work well for most use cases.

        This article has been short, but it sets everything ready to start tweaking the configuration 
        of Solr and understanding how this search engine works, which I'll write about in the 
        future (hopefully not a far away one).

        Until next time!
