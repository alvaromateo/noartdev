            In this post I will show how to install and configure 
            <Link href='https://solr.apache.org/'>Solr</Link> to use it as search engine for a blog
            website.

        <Link href='https://solr.apache.org/'>Solr</Link> has a couple installation possibilities. 
        There's the classic manual installation and also the possibility to run it in a Docker 
        container. I believe going through with the Docker installation is better in the long term, 
        as it leaves more options open to choose a Cloud provider - I could choose a VPS or run it 
        directly in a containerized Cloud environment. In addition, once done the setup if I need 
        to deploy it to different environments I won't need to repeat all the manual installation 
        work.

        ## Docker

        First I focused on setting up the development environment. I do this for fun, so I don't want 
        to have to struggle everytime I try to code something. It has to be smooth and simple to run, 
        still giving me access to all the benefits of Next development process (mainly HMR - Hot Module 
        Replacement).

        To do the set up of the environment (both for development and for production) I decided to go 
        with <Link href='https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/'>Docker Compose</Link> 
        because it's a technology I had already used in the past a bit, and I know that I can get all the 
        environment up and running by just typing:

        <CodeBlock language='bash'>
{`docker compose up`}
        </CodeBlock>

        ### Set up

        The setup is very simple. I just followed the instructions on how to deploy using Docker available 
        in the NextJS 
        <Link href='https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying#docker-image'>docs</Link>. 
        I used the multi environment example provided to set up 2 environments:
        - A development environment to use in my laptop.
        - A production environment that is the one I will use when I want to do the deployment to GCP.

        I modified the exmaple 

        ## Conclusion

        In this post I've summarized what is Solr and what can you get out of it for your website. 
        I've also explored basic concepts and definitions that are needed to make a proper Solr implementation. 
        In future posts I'll continue to explore how to use Solr to add search functionalities to your 
        own website.

        Until next time!
