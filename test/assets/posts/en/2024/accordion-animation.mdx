        <Summary>
            In this post I will explain my journey to create an accordion or dropdown (un)folding
            animation that makes the contents grow in height. The framework used is NextJs with Typescript 
            and for the animations I used <Link href='http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition'>
            CSSTransition from react-transition-group</Link>. 
            Let's dive straight in!

        ## Height transition

        My first approach was to try the simplest way I could think of: 
        just set a transition for the height from <CodeBlock inline language='css'>height: 0px</CodeBlock> 
        to <CodeBlock inline language='css'>height: auto</CodeBlock> and let the browser handle all the rest.

        Unluckily for me, this doesn't work. The browser is not that smart (yet) 
        and can't animate a height transition without specific values. 
        Makes sense, but still: it was worth a try.

        This got me thinking: how can I calculate dynamically the height of the accordion/dropdown content
        so that I can set it and create a transition that renders the animation I want?

        ## Render the content invisible

        The second idea I got was a bit better than the first, but not perfect. If I want to get the height of
        a content I just need to render that content invisible on the DOM by setting 
        <CodeBlock inline language='css'>visibility: hidden</CodeBlock>, then I can get the height of it and 
        add the real element setting its height.

        <CodeBlock language='typescript'>
{`'use client'

import { useCallback, useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react'
import { CSSTransition } from 'react-transition-group'

export default function Accordion({
    children,
    accordionDisplayed,
    timeout,
} : {
    children: React.ReactNode,
    accordionDisplayed: boolean,
    timeout?: number,
}) {
    timeout = timeout || 1500
    const nodeRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)
    const accordionDisplayedRef = useRef<boolean>(accordionDisplayed)
    const [contentHeight, setContentHeight] = useState<number | null>(null)
    const [animationPlaying, setAnimationPlaying] = useState<boolean>(false)

    if (accordionDisplayedRef.current !== accordionDisplayed) {
        setAnimationPlaying(true)
        accordionDisplayedRef.current = accordionDisplayed
    }

    useEffect(() => {
        if (!animationPlaying) return
        const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
            setAnimationPlaying(false)
        }, timeout)
        return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId)
    }, [animationPlaying, timeout])

    const onRefChange = useCallback((node: HTMLDivElement | null) => {
        if (node) {
            const childNodes = node.getElementsByTagName('div')
            if (childNodes.length > 0) {
                setContentHeight(childNodes[0].clientHeight)
            }
        }
    }, [])

    let displayClasses = ''
    if (!accordionDisplayed) {
        if (!animationPlaying) {
            displayClasses = 'hidden'
        }
        if (!contentHeight) {
            displayClasses = 'absolute invisible'
        }
    }

    return (
        <CSSTransition
        nodeRef={nodeRef}
        in={accordionDisplayed}
        timeout={timeout}
        classNames='accordion'
        onEnter={() => {
            if (nodeRef.current) {
                nodeRef.current.style.height = '0px'
            }
        }}
        onEntering={() => {
            if (nodeRef.current) {
                nodeRef.current.style.height = \`\${contentHeight}px\`
                nodeRef.current.style.transition = \`height \${timeout}ms ease-out\`
            }
        }}
        onEntered={() => {
            if (nodeRef.current) {
                nodeRef.current.style.height = \`\${contentHeight}px\`
            }
        }}
        onExit={() => {
            if (nodeRef.current) {
                nodeRef.current.style.height = \`\${contentHeight}px\`
            }
        }}
        onExiting={() => {
            if (nodeRef.current) {
                nodeRef.current.style.height = '0px'
                nodeRef.current.style.transition = \`height \${timeout}ms ease-out\`
            }
        }}
        onExited={() => {
            if (nodeRef.current) {
                nodeRef.current.style.height = '0px'
            }
        }}
        >
        <div className='relative' aria-hidden={!accordionDisplayed} ref={onRefChange}>
            <div className={\`\${displayClasses} overflow-hidden\`} ref={nodeRef}>
                {children}
            </div>
        </div>
        </CSSTransition>
    )
}
`}
        </CodeBlock>

        The parent component has the control of when to open the accordion by passing the
        <CodeBlock inline language='typescript'>accordionDisplayed</CodeBlock> prop and this 
        component stores if it has to display the content of the accordion in a ref.
        This is because the parent component might change the prop, but the
        animation takes a bit to complete (controled by the timeout prop), so the component
        will still be displayed as it shrinks. The first if condition checks to see if the
        prop changed respect to the current ref: if it did, then it sets a state to indicate
        that the animation/transition has started to play.

        I have to take care of setting the state of the animation back to 'not playing' and
        for that there's a <CodeBlock inline language='typescript'>useEffect</CodeBlock> hoook
        that is executed everytime the state changes. This hook sets a timer (equal to the time that
        the transition takes) that when expires sets the 'playing' state back to false.

        Then comes the trick to get the height! I use a 
        <Link href='https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common#ref-callback'>ref callback</Link>
        to execute a function when the DOM element gets rendered and in this function I set the content
        height state to the actual height of the content with
        <CodeBlock inline language='typescript'>childNodes[0].clientHeight</CodeBlock>.

        It's almost done! It's just missing the logic for when to hide completely the DOM element 
        <CodeBlock inline language='css'>display: none;</CodeBlock> and when to hide it by making it invisible
        but still let it take space so that I can get the height. This is the case when the accordion is
        not displayed and the content height state is not yet set, in which case I make the component invisible
        and with an absolute position to take it out of the document flow and that it doesn't interfere with
        the layout of the page. If the accordion is not displayed and the animation is not playing then it gets
        hidden, and in all other cases it is displayed.

        The last part of the code is the JSX that takes displays the content and sets the 
        <Link href='http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition'>CSSTransition</Link>
        props necessary to trigger the transition of the height.

        At this point I was very happy and everything looked like it was working fine, until the content of the
        accordion changed and thus its height and the animation looked like shit. I was in need of a better 
        solution...

        ## useLayoutEffect to the rescue

        I won't lie to you. I didn't know how to tackle the problem, so at this point I decided to ask a 
        good friend of mine how would he solve this situation. His answer was a piece of advice I have heard 
        multiple times, but I had completely overlooked. He said:

        <blockquote>

            Why don't you use an already existing accordion from a library like 
            <Link href='https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion'>shadcn</Link>

        </blockquote>

        Duuuh! How didn't I think of this sooner? Well, I wanted to learn how to do this by myself, so 
        that's why. But the advice made me realize that I could check how the accordion of this library works. 
        So I went to their GitHub and checked and that's when I discovered the all mighty
        <Link href='https://react.dev/reference/react/useLayoutEffect'>useLayoutEffect</Link>.

        It's a hook I had never used and didn't even know it existed. But it does exactly what I needed.
        This hook fires before the browser repaints the screen, so I can render my component without worrying
        about making it invisible and in this hook then set the content height state, which triggers another
        render of the component and then it gets to the DOM with the correct height for the transition. In
        addition, if the content of the accordion changes the hook runs again and sets the height correctly
        and in time for correctly drawing the result to screen.

        <CodeBlock language='typescript'>
{`useLayoutEffect(() => {
    const node = nodeRef.current
    if (node) {
        const elements = node.getElementsByTagName('div')
        if (elements.length > 0) {
            const contentWrapper = elements[0]
            const rect = contentWrapper.getBoundingClientRect()
            if (rect.height !== 0 && rect.height !== contentHeight) {
                setContentHeight(rect.height)
                node.style.height = \`\${rect.height}px\`
            }
        }
    }
}, [children])
`}
        </CodeBlock>

        ## Conclusion

        By using the <CodeBlock inline language='typescript'>useLayoutEffect</CodeBlock> hook the accordion
        now works fine in all cases, even if the content inside changes. In addition, the component got rid
        of all the logic to set different classes in order to render the component invisible, which makes it
        simpler to maintain. Lastly, with this hook I can convey much more clearly which are 
        my intentions which makes it simpler to understand what it does.

        Until next time!
