        ## Solr

        Apache Solr is an open source search server built on top of Apache Lucene, a Java information 
        retrieval library. Queries are sent to Solr via HTTP requests and the response is usually a list 
        of document descriptors (JSON being the default response format). 
        I say usually because Solr is highly customizable.

        All the information in this page has been extracted from the official 
        <Link href='https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/index.html'>Solr documentation</Link>, so 
        you can head there if you want to read more about any of the topics here. This will try to be a 
        quicker introduction. Before starting to integrate Solr there is some concepts and terminology 
        to be learnt.
